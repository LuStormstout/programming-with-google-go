# Go Programming Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning journey through the "Programming with Google Go" course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang). The course consists of three parts:

1. **Getting Started with Go**
2. **Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go**
3. **Concurrency in Go**

Each part of the course covers essential topics in Go programming, providing a comprehensive understanding of the language.

## Contents

- [Getting Started with Go](/getting-started): Exercises and code snippets from the first part of the course.
- [Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go](/functions-methods-interfaces): Code examples and practice problems related to functions, methods, and interfaces.
- [Concurrency in Go](/concurrency): Implementation and exploration of concurrent programming concepts in Go.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the folders corresponding to each course part. Inside each folder, you will find code examples, exercises, and additional resources to aid your learning process.
